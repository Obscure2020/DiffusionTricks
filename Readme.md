# Diffusion Tricks Project

Currently being worked on by Joey Sodergren and Akash Prasad. More description to be added later.

## Initial Setup
To set up the python virtual environment and download the SDXL model weights for this project, perform the following sequence of steps.

1. Open a terminal into the directory containing this repo.
1. Grant execute permissions to the initial setup script.
    ```sh
    chmod 755 initSetup.sh
    ```
1. Run the setup script itself.
    ```sh
    ./initSetup.sh
    ```

**Warning:** Depending on the download speed of your internet connection, the initial setup script may take a very long time to complete its work.

The setup script will tell you when it is complete by printing this message to the console:
```
Project environment setup complete.
```
